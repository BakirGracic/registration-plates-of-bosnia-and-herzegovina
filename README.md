# Registration Plates of Bosnia and Herzegovina (3 types)

### This project contains all possible variations from 3 types of registration plates in Bosnia and Herzegovina (C++ code, executable, text file)

### Explanation

####  1) Regular plates
- Format: X00-X-000
- 9 characters per plate
- X is one of letters: A, E, O, J, K, M, T
- 00 or 000 is a number from 0-99 or 0-999
- dash is a syntax character
- 4.900.000 combinations
- ~53mb .txt file

####  2) Taxi plates
- Format: TA-000000
- 9 characters per plate
- TA are syntax characters
- 000000 is a number from 0-999999
- dash is a syntax character
- 1.000.000 combinations
- ~11mb .txt file

####  3) Diplomatic plates
- Format: CC-X-000 or CCCC-X-000
- 8 or 10 characters per plate
- CC or CCCC are diplomatic codes [(list)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina#Diplomatic,_consular_and_foreign_mission_plate_prefixes)
- X is one of letters: A, C, M, E
- 000 is a number from 0-999
- dash is a syntax character
- 276.000 combinations
- ~2.8mb .txt file

### Backstory
The idea for creating this project was born when I had been lectured probabilistics on my math class. My teacher gave us a task to calculate the amount of possible combinations for B&H registration plates using the given format. Although being 30min late to my class (from coding all night 😉) I was swiftly able to find the correct number of possible combinations (which is 4.9m)  and challenged myself to have a full list of all those registration plates. I chose C++ mainly because of it's speed, simplicity and I was comfortable writing it. Contrary to popular belief that any program (except Hello World and really simple ones) couldn't be executed without bugs on first try, believe it or not, I was able to write all 3 of these programs that executed correctly and successfully on first try!

### How to
- download .txt files and use them that way
- you can generate .txt files on your own by executing .exe files (disable antivirus programs), generation duration depends on your device, 100mb of space required for all 3 types of plates
- you can view and study my code by opening .cpp files (I recommend Visual Studio because it has in-built compiler and debugger, or any IDE similar to it)
